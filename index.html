										<h3><left>MicroClimate Weather network (SDG&E)</left></h3>
										<p>In collaboration with SDG&E, we developed a microclimate weather system consisting of a website to display weather data, a server to store weather data, and a weather network to collect data. What is unique about our system is its small deployment radius and high accuracy. One of the many applications of our system is in determining where the best place is to install long term, high cost equipment. Through the user’s analysis of our system’s data, the user can determine the best place to deploy high cost, long use equipment based on how the equipment is expected to wear due to differeing weather conditions. Through the analysis of weather systems data, the user can extend the life of their long use equipment and save money in the upkeep of that equipment. 

												Our weather sensing network is comprised of Sub nodes and super nodes where super nodes have a full weather sensor package and Sub nodes have a limited weather sensor package. The Sub nodes collect data and send it to one of two super nodes which in turn send data to the server where data is displayed by the website for the user.

										<h3><left>C# Alarm Clock GUI</left></h3>
										<p>Developed a C# application for an Alarm clock interface that allowed user to setup alarms, appointments, and a To-do list. The interface incorporated a digital clock, picture library, and buttons that opened separate forms for an appointment book, alarms, and To-Do list. The software utilized multiple timers that would run in parallel to the application. If the user entered an appointment on a specific day or time, the application would open at that time, displaying a dialog with the reminder and playing a *.wav file in a loop until the dialog is closed. The software was written using the GUI Toolbox within the Visual Studios IDE.</p>

				<a href="https://github.com/Yusufsh27/4x4VerilogKeypad" target="_blank" title="Github link for 4x4 Keypad FPGA Project"><h3>FPGA 4x4 Keypad Integration: (Verilog Programing)</h3></a>
				<p>Integrated a 4x4 Keypad to an FPGA in Verilog code. An FPGA is similar to that of a microcontroller, but rather than having the processor jump from one part of the code to another simulating parallelism, an FPGA is where all the code runs in parallel simultaneously. The 4x4 keypad is setup with 8 total pins, 4 Rows & 4 Columns. The 4 row pins were connected to I/O pins on the FPGA as input PULLDOWN pins, and the 4 column pins were connected as output PULLUP pins. Therefor as each column went high and a button on the keypad was pressed the voltage outputting from the FPGA would flow through the closed button and back into the input pins on the FPGA. Using case statements to recognize which row and column was pressed, I could display the correct number or symbol on the 7 Segment LED display</p>

				<a href="https://github.com/Yusufsh27/Best-path-end-to-end-in-a-233-Hexagon-array" target="_blank" title="Github link for Best Path 233 Hexagon Project"><h3>Best path end-to-end in a 233-Hexagon array: (C++ Programing)</h3></a>
				<p>Developed a C++ program that reads a text file with 233 random numbers ranging from 1-999. The program would then place a number inside each of the 233 hexagons correspondingly. We then developed a rendering of dijkstra's algorithm to find the best path from the bottom left corner to the top right that cost the least. Our program executed in 0.000543 seconds.</p>

				<h3>Fan alteration by heat detection: (C Programing)</h3></a>
				<p>Explored the capabilities of a PIC Microcontroller to alter a fans speed based on the temperature of a thermometer sensor. Created a Wheatstone bridge that incorporated a thermometer on one of the legs and an interweaved an Op-Amp. The output of the Op-Amp was used as the input for the PIC microcontroller. The input that was coming in would be an analog signal and had to be converted to a Digital Signal. Used the on board ADC register to do this, and stored the value in a temporary onboard register ADRESH. Created case statements which compared ADRESH to a hard coded value which would alter the fan speed using Pulse Width Modulation.</p>
				
				<a href="https://github.com/Yusufsh27/Single-Cycle-Processor" target="_blank" title="Github link for Single Cycle Processor Project"><h3>Single Cycle Processor: (Verilog Programing)</h3></a>
				<p>Developed the computer architecture for a single cycle processor in Verilog. The design consisted of an instruction memory buffer, register file, arithmetic logic unit, data memory buffer, control unit, various addition operators, switches and clocks. The final system was able to read a MIPS file and execute it's commands (such as add,sub,and,or..etc) and store the values in registers.</p>

				<a href="https://github.com/Yusufsh27/Filter-Audio-File" target="_blank" title="Github link for Filter Audio File Project"><h3>Filtering an Audio File: (MATLAB Programing)</h3></a>
				<p>Explored Matlab’s capabilities of reading, writing and cleaning audio signals. Recorded audio ends up with unintentional residual low-level sound, “Audio Noise”. Luckily with post-processing development we were able to remove most noise and clean up the audio signal. An audio signal is a range of electrical voltage between 0 and VDD, which make up frequencies. To clean the audio signal, we found its impulse response, which is a finite discrete-time sequence, to observe any unwanted frequencies. Then we designed and used multiple FIR filters removing the unwanted frequencies. The four types of Linear-Phase FIR filters that we used were: low-pass filter, high-pass filter, band-pass filter, band-stop filter.</p>

				<p>In a synchronous FIFO, data values are written sequentially into a memory array using a clock signal, and the data values are sequentially read out from the memory array using the same clock signal. I developed Verilog code to resemble this FIFO memory which included a memory array, write
						control logic, and read control logic. The memory array was implemented as a dual‐port read/write
						memory with simultaneous read and write accesses. I used a single clock port for both the read and write operation, date input & output registers, write & read enable inputs, and finally full, empty, almost full, and almost empty flags controlled using binary pointers. </p>

				<a href="https://github.com/Yusufsh27/TCP-Client-Server-Connection" target="_blank" title="Github link for TCP Client-Server Connection Project"><h3>TCP Client-Server Socket Connection: (C Programing)</h3></a>
				<p>Generated a network socket between client and server. The ‘Server Code’ was contained in a public server, while the ‘Client Code’ was contained in a different public server. Began by binding the client to the address (port & host machine) of a server listening for a connection. Once the connection was accepted the client & server could send/receive data. Commands Used: connect, close, bind, listen read and write.</p>

				<a href="https://github.com/Yusufsh27/Video-Compression" target="_blank" title="Github link for Video Compression Project"><h3>Video Compression: (MATLAB Programing)</h3></a>
				<p>Using my knowledge of Video Compression, I developed a script to compress videos using motion compensation and discrete cosine transform (DCT) techniques. I Calculated motion vectors between successive frames and used them to minimize redundant information. I then divided each frame into smaller sub-frame matrices allowing for more precise compression on each individual sub-matrix. I then recombined all sub-matrices back together and finally applied a quantization technique to achieve further compression. Bellow is the Step-By-Step process in which the compression occurred.

						Splitting the video into frames, RGB to YCbCr conversion of frames, 4:4:4 to 4:2:0 conversion, Motion Estimation and vectoring, DCT, Quantize, Zig Zag and RLE ordering, Encoding, Decoding, DeQuantization, IDCT, Reconstruct I and P Frames, and combine frames into compressed video.</p>
				
				<a href="https://github.com/Yusufsh27/Atmega-Noise-Sensing-Device" target="_blank" title="Github link for Atmega Noise Sensing Device Project"><h3>ATMEGA Noise Sensing Device: (C Programing)</h3></a>
				<p>I developed a system that would be able to play sound imitations and display the corresponding frequency levels of the sounds on an L.E.D. Screen. Using an AVR embedded system board I programed a code to use the board’s IO pins (Rx,Tx, IO) to read buttons & sensors and write to L.E.D.s & speakers. 

						The board recognizes as a button is pressed and plays a sound through the speakers. The Noise sensor then detects the frequency at which the sound is being played at and saving the value as a character in the system. Using the Board's Transmit Pin, i could transmit characters to the LED screen having the screen display the frequency at which the sound was played at. A 5th button was incorporated to increment the other button’s noise levels.</p>
				
				<a href="https://github.com/Yusufsh27/Raspberry-Pi-Radio" target="_blank" title="Github link for Raspberry Pi Radio Project"><h3>Raspberry Pi Radio Project: (C Programing)</h3></a>
				<p>Using a Raspberry Pi, a linux based Arduino like device, I created an imitation of a radio. I programmed a code that would go online and receive website radio stations and save them in an array. I then wired a proto-board to contain pause, play, next, forward buttons; I then attached wires from the Pi's I/O pins to the proto-board and programing accordingly. Once the program ran it would recognize once a button was pressed and play the first station in the array. The buttons would then do their respective jobs if pressed.</p>
